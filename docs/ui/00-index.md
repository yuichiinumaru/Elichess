# Design System Overview

This directory documents the "Elegant" design system used in the Chess Server frontend. The system is implemented using CSS variables in `priv/static/css/style.css` and vanilla HTML/JS components.

## Core Principles
- **Elegance:** Dark theme with gold accents mimics a premium chess experience.
- **Simplicity:** No build tools, just pure CSS and JS.
- **Responsiveness:** Board scales with viewport (`min(80vh, 600px)`).
- **Feedback:** Visual indicators for selection, moves, and game status.

## Directory Structure
- `01-colors.md`: Color palette and usage.
- `02-typography.md`: Font choices and text hierarchy.
- `03-components.md`: Reusable UI components.
